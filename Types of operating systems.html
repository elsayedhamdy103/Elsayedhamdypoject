            <p><big>Single-tasking and multi-tasking
                A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time, while a multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency. This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes. 
                These processes are each interrupted repeatedly in time slices by a task-scheduling subsystem of the operating system.
                 Multi-tasking may be characterized in preemptive and co-operative types. In preemptive multitasking, the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates a slot to each of the programs. Unix-like operating systems, such as Solaris and Linux—as well as non-Unix-like, 
                 such as AmigaOS—support preemptive multitasking. Cooperative multitasking is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner. 16-bit versions of Microsoft Windows used cooperative multi-tasking; 32-bit versions of both Windows NT and Win9x used preemptive multi-tasking.
                
                Single- and multi-user
                Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem.
                 A multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources,
                  such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits multiple users to interact with the system at the same time. 
                  Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time,
                   mass storage, printing, and other resources to multiple users.
